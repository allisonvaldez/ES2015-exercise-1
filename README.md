This is the an exercise to practice refactoring some ES5 code into ES2015 for "Let and Const" for Lesson 15.2. If any changes need to be made do let me know.

Questions:

1. What is the difference between var and let?
- let: can reassign, cannot redeclare, block scope, can mutate
- var (should not be really used): can reassign, can redeclare, function scope, can mutate.

2. What is the difference between var and const?
- var (should not be really used): can be reassigned, can be redeclared, function scope, can mutate.
- Const: cannot be reassigned, cannot be redeclared, block scoped, and can mutate.

3. What is the difference between let and const?
- let: can reassign, cannot redeclare, block scope, can mutate
- const: cannot reassign, cannot redeclare, block scope, can mutate.

4. What is hoisting?
- Most commonly used with var. The application will put all declarations using this keyword to the top of the file with an initial value of undefined. It is declared but not initialized with a value yet.
